## How to set up the plugin?

### 1. Download the latest version
- Latest stable releases are always published on <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/80910/">Spigot.org</a>.

Put the downloaded plugin into your server's `plugins/` folder.

### 2. Download the resource pack
- **Download the resource pack.** Use the link https://mtvehicles.nl/resourcepack/! (We've also created a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSXNd-6rhQk">YouTube tutorial</a>).

You may set it as a server resource pack, or everyone would have to download the resource pack individually. (For instance, take a look <a href="https://apexminecrafthosting.com/how-to-upload-a-resource-pack/" taget="_blank">here</a>.)

> ‚ö† The vehicles WON'T look properly without the resource pack.

### 3. Restart the server
Restart the server. No explanation needed, right? Right?

### 4. Enjoy!
**Et voil√†, it's working!** Don't forget to set your language using `/vehicle language`.<br>

If this did not work don't hesitate to contact the support on our Discord server.
